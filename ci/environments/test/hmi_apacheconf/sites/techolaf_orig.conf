    # The ProxyPass directive specifies the mapping of incoming requests to the backend server (or a cluster of servers known as a Balancer group).
    # It proxies the requests only with matching URI “/blog”

    ProxyPass /api https://18.252.228.173:5000/KMAPI

    #To ensure that and Location: headers generated from the backend are modified to point to the reverse proxy, instead of back to itself, #the ProxyPassReverse directive is most often required:

    ProxyPassReverse /api https://18.252.228.173:5000/KMAPI
